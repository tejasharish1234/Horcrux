Problem: 
People buy a ticket for a stop A, when in fact they want to get down at stop B, a stop further from A, knowing that the conductor will not be able to verify that all passengers are getting down at the right stop.
This may seem like a very small issue considering 1 individual case, but looking at a larger picture where multiple people do this over many days and the number of buses in the city, this can be a huge loss to the government.

Solution:
An app which allows users to book tickets which generates a QR Code. On entering the bus, conductor scans the QR Code confirming passenger is onboard. When the passenger wishes to get down, they simply press end ride on their phone to signal their exit. If a person has stayed on beyond the stop mentioned on the ticket, necessary fines are applied. Location tracking is used for the duration of the bus ride and for 1 minute after. The minute after is to check whether passenger has deboarded by comparing their position and the buses position which should be different given they have deboarded.

More details and a video of the app working are in the presentation.
